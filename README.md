For this assignment I decided to use the front-end JavaScript, images and css files from the demo app referenced in the homework instructions.  I was able to obtain these files by using the Chrome Dev Tools and viewing the source via the inspector.  My goal was to not modify any of the front-end code listed above and to get the app to look and work exactly as the demo does.  This was a lot more difficult than I anticipated.  

I'm interested to see the source code of the demo, as I'm willing to bet my Node implmenation (API Routes, HTML Routes, Handlebars, Mongoose Model, etc.) is very similar.  With that said, I did modify the front-end somewwhat. I didn't like how the cards in the demo extended the full width of the screen, so I made my cards smaller, allowing for multiple cards (articles) per row. For this assignment, I used the following technologies:

1. Mongo
1. Mongoose
1. express
1. express-handlebars
1. cheerio
1. axios
1. Heroku
